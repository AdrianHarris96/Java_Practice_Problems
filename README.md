## Examples 
- `Battleship.java`: Single script that mimicks a scaled back version of the board game, Battleship. The board is miniaturized (5x5), and ships are represent as 1D rather than 2D. 

## Algorithms 
- `binarySearch.java`: Perform a binary search on an ordered, integer array by progressively halving, searching the half of interest and discarding the other half. 
- `mergeSort.java`: Perform a merge sort on an integer array by dividing the array until reaching the atomic units of the array and then progressively comparing/merging these units. 
- `selectionSort.java`: Perform a selection sort on an integer array by finding the index of the minimum value and moving it to the leftmost point of the array (AKA the sorted portion of the array).
